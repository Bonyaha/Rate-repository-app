<!-- I replaced "start": "expo start" with this: "start": Ñ‚"set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && expo start " and it started working (source: `https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/issues/4037`) -->

I put this in vscode settings:	
```"eslint.workingDirectories": [
			{
				"mode": "auto"
			}
		],
```
I did this because Eslint gave me an error in App.js file in this line: **import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'**

I've added file advancedFeatures.ini in my computer to the path C:/Users/your user name/.android with this content:
Vulkan = off
GLDirectMem = on

it was neccesary because Chrome browser didn't open on emulator

### Debouncing in filtering doesn't working good. Even so I used 500 and 200 and 100 in time (useDebounce(searchQuery, 0)), it was extremely slow. I don't know why it's happenning (maybe because of dependancies issues and me using --legal-peer-deps flag every time).So I just put 0. In trade-off, I can't use now searchbarRef.current.blur() for removing focus, because it happens so fast, that focus lost after every keystroke.
## Comands:
1.npm start - start the Expo development tools
2. npm run lint - check linting rules2. 
3. how to connect react native debugger with emulator android - on Android emulator, you need to press ctrl + M and press 'Debug remote JS'
4. how to set the React Native debugger port to 19000 - Ctrl+T (without it it won't be able to connect to emulator)
5. It's important to always opent React Native debugger before opening emulator. Without it, it won't open and will give an error.
